            <h1>Summit-Ethereum FAQs</h1>
            <p>
                <b>Summit-Ethereum</b> is a system hardcoded into the Ethereum blockchain (thus called a "smart contract").
				It cannot be modified nor deleted unless Ethereum cease to exist. The system follows a list of conditions and follows a set of commands.
				All these are automated and cannot be compromised due to how the blockchain technology operates.
            </p>
            
            
            <h1>What is Ethereum?</h1>
            <p>Ethereum <b>(ETH)</b> is one of the leading worldwide crypto-currencies, established in 2015 and now standing next to Bitcoin(BTC).
			The blockchain of the cryptocurrency allows developers to create smart contracts. A huge number of large crypto-companies use this currency.
            </p>
            
            <h1>What is a Smart Contract?</h1>
            <p>Smart contract is the algorithm stored inside the blockchain of cryptocurrencies. In our case&mdash;Ethereum&mdash;is number one among the those on which it is possible to create smart contracts. The main purpose of such contracts is the automation of commands from various conditions coming from user inputs.</p>
            
            
            <h1>Who manages the system?</h1>
            <p>
                <b>Summit-Ethereum</b> is fully decentralized&mdash;no administrators.<br>
                The creators of the platform are also project participants like you.
            </p>
            
            
            <h1>What do I need to join?</h1>
            <p>
                You only need a smartphone or a PC with an Ethereum wallet application installed on the device.
                <br>
                Your wallet must have the required registration fee plus gas fees
                <br>
                <b>0.04ETH registration fee</b><br>
                <b>0.011-0.026ETH gas fee</b><br>
                <b>~0.066ETH total</b>

            <h1>Can I register to the system without a referrer?</h1>
            <p>
                <b>Yes!</b>
                <br><br>
                You will be assigned under a random superior and can then start building your Matrix.
            </p>
            
            <h1>Possible passive income?</h1>
            <p>
                <b>Yes!</b>
                <br><br>
                Because every transaction in registration and upgrade invests 5% to the entire Summit-Ethereum network, which is evenly distributed to all
                the <b>current</b> Summit-Ethereum members.
                <br>
                <b>Summit Multilevel</b> is arranged in such a way that all participants help each other.
                You can obtain spillovers from your superiors or invites, however, if you want to make a lot of money fast, doing nothing will not work.
                <br>
                To provide a passive income in the future, you need to make some effort to invite people and unlock new levels in direct matrix and multilevel matrix.
                Inviting a few active people in your team, you will be able to earn good money and achieve their goals. How quickly this will happen depends on you.
            </p>
            
            
            <h1>Is my Ethereum stored in the system?</h1>
            <p>
                <b>Only your shares of the investment. </b> Your ethereum go directly to the wallet of their receivers minus the <b>5%</b> investment.
            </p>
            
            
            <h1>Why is there a 5% investment?</h1>
            <p>
                Investments are good because Ethereum prices can go <b>high</b>. Even if you withdraw all ETH from your wallet, <b>you will still have something from Summit-Ethereum!</b>
            </p>
            
            
            
            <h1>Can I withdraw my shares?</h1>
            <p>
                <b>Yes you can, anytime.</b> But also take note of the <b>gas prices</b> because <b>if gas fees are higher than what you withdraw, your wallet will be charged instead!</b>
            </p>
            
            
            <h1>What is GAS in the Ethereum blockchain?</h1>
            <p>
                Gas is the <b>transaction fee</b> of the Ethereum blockchain. Gas prices depends on how the system operates. The longer the system operates, the higher the gas price is.
            </p>
            

            
            <h1>How does the Summit Matrices work?</h1>
            <p>
                <b>Summit Matrix</b> is a closed system, without deadlines for levels, with a limited number of slots and an unlimited number of refresh.
                <br><br>
                Both Direct &amp; Multilevel matrices have 12 levels. All similar and work in the same way.
                Each level needs to be unlocked (level-1 is automatically unlocked when you join!), requiring twice the unlock price of the previous level. 
                <br><br>
                In the matrix, the referral link is fixed to the person who invited you. You always follow your superior partner, to each of the slots he activates.
                <br><br>
                In the <b>Direct Matrix</b>, below you is three slots in one line. In the <b>Multilevel Matrix</b>, below you are two levels â€“ 2 slots in the first line and 4 slots in the second.
                <br>
                <br>
                For all the information on how the levels work, go to our guide:<br>

            <h1>Is this different from the Pyramid?</h1>
            <p>
                <b>Yes.</b>
                <br><br>
                Summit-Ethereum is a <b>decentralized, crowdfunded system</b>&mdash; made to be consistent, precise and direct without any hidden schemes.
                <br><br>
                The principle of a financial pyramid is based on the fact that most of the money is concentrated on the hands of the creators.
                The sooner you come, the more money.
                <br><br>
                The participants of Summit-Ethereum &ndash; both leaders and newcomers &ndash; are equal.
                <br><br>
                A pyramid scheme can be closed at any time.
