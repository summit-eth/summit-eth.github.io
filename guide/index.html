            <h1>How does the Summit Matrix work?</h1>
            <p>
                In the matrix, the referral link is fixed the person who invited you.
                You always follow your superior partner, to each of the levels he unlocks.
                <br>
                Each matrices have 12 levels to be unlocked the same way.
                <br>
                Each subsequent level is 2 times more expensive than the previous one. Both income and profits from them are twice as high!
                <br>
                All active levels move and bring you revenue in parallel.
                <br>
                Let's say you have invited a new person and you have unlocked level-3. That person will go down to your level-1 matrix. When that person unlocks level-2, he will go directly on your level-2 matrix.
                <br>

            </p>
            
           
            <h1>Registration</h1>
            <p>
            The first slot of each matrix costs <b>0.02 ETH</b>. They are bought together; separately, the first matrix cannot be taken.
            Accordingly, the start to the matrix is generally <b>0.04 ETH</b>. You can purchase all further levels separately, in order from the smaller to the larger.
            It is impossible to unlock a level-3 without having a level-2 open.
            <br>

            </p>
            
            <h1>Direct Matrix flow</h1>
            <p>
                All partners in your matrix of the Direct Matrix are your personally referral partners. When you invite partners, they take places under you in the Direct Matrix.
                The distribution of payments when filling out the matrix automatically occurs as follows:
                <br>
                1. The <b>first and second</b> referral partner that takes place under you: 95% payout goes to your personal wallet (starts at 0.019). The remaining is for your investment in shares.
                <br>
                2. The <b>third</b> partner that takes place on the 3rd slot: You again receive 100% income, but it will automatically be paid as a refresh for the current level (payout is equal to level unlock price).
                <br>
                3. <b>Refresh</b> opens the same level for you again, and you continue to receive new partners from it. Reopening the level, you take the next free place in your superior partners’ slot. Accordingly, the 95% refresh fee is transferred to your superior.
                <br>
                <img src="img/guide/direct-how.jpg">

            <h1>Multilevel Matrix flow</h1>
            <p>
                In parallel, the Multilevel matrix also works for you. Here an overflow system is organized from above and from below.
                We are building a team together. There may be at least all of you invited, at least not one invited by you, or mixed.
                <br>
                <b>1 > 2 > Partners</b> who takes two places below you in the first line: 95% payment of the matrix(starts at 0.019) goes to the wallet of your <b>higher partner</b>.
                <br>
                <b>3 > 4 > 5</b> > You receive the 95% from four people but only 3 payments go instantly to your wallet.
                <br>
                <b>6</b> > The last payout is the closing slot, and it also makes a reinvest just like in the direct matrix, buying you the same level again, and the payment of 95% is transferred to your higher partner.
                <br>
                <img src="img/guide/multi-how.jpg">
            </p>
            
            
            <h1>Refresh</h1>
            <p>
            <b>REINVEST</b> – this is the re-opening (purchase) of the level at the current level.
            <br>
            Refresh opens the same level for you again, and you continue to receive income from it. Without refreshment, this level would close, and that’s it.
            <br>
            Refresh takes place automatically, as soon as you occupy the last free place, the current level closes and goes to the archive.
            <br>
            You re-occupy the free space in the level with a higher partner and a new level with free places opens for you, and 95% payment goes to the wallet of your higher partner.
            <br>
            Similarly, your referral partners will have refreshments, and you will instantly receive income every time.
            <br>
            <img src="img/guide/refresh.jpg">
            </p>
            
            <h1>Unlock  </h1>
            <p>
                <b>Unlock</b> – is the opening (purchase) of the next level and is only done once per level. The payment goes to your superior partner, provided that he has already unlocked the level to be purchased.
                <br>
                There is enough income from each level to refresh the same level and unlock the next level!
                <br>
                You decide whether to purchase the next level level but it is recommended that you should always be ahead of your downlines.
                <br>
                A refresh of the level occurs automatically. If the next level is not open for you, then all payments will be redirected to a higher partner.
                <br>
                When you buy the necessary level, then at the next refresh, your referral partner will take a place under you, and with each refresh will take a place under you again.
                <br>
                <b>Lost profit</b> – payment left to a higher partner, due to the lack of an upgrade to a more expensive slot.
                <br>
                <b>Extra profit</b> – payment received to you at the expense of the Lost profit of a lower partner.
            </p>
            
            <h1>Overflows, Overtaking &amp; Returns </h1>
            <p>
                You can <b>overtake</b> your superior partner by opening slots which he has not yet reached.
                <br>
                In this case, you get up to his superior partner, the closest who has unlocked the level, and the income goes to him.
                <br>
                If he doesn’t have this level available, then in the same way you are already overtaking two superiors until the system finds a partner who already has active slot of this level.
                <br>
                Referral link returns the partners. This means that when your superior unlocks the level, then the next refresh, you will again take a place under him.
            </p>
            
            <h1>95%, 5% Investment &amp; Shares</h1>
            <p>
                <b>95%</b> of each registration fee &amp; unlock fee is transferred automatically to whoever falls on the system's algorithm.
                <br>
                <b>5%</b> of each registration fee &amp; unlock fee is evenly distributed to all current users registered on Summit-Eth.com
                <br>
                <b>Your shares are withdrawable anytime</b>, but you must take note of the <b>gas fee</b> for the transaction!
